    "Are you going to Scarborough Fair?",
    "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme",
    "Remember me to one who lives there",
    "She once was a true love of mine",
    "Tell her to make me a cambric shirt",
    "(in the deep forest green)",
    "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme",
    "(Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground)",
    "Without no seams nor needle work",
    "(Bedclothes the child of the mountain)",
    "Then she'll be a true love of mine",
    "(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)",
    "Tell her to find me an acre of land",
    "(A sprinkling of leaves)",
    "Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme",
    "(Washes the grave with silvery tears)",
    "Between the salt water and the sea strands",
    "(And polishes a gun)",
    "Then she'll be a true love of mine",
    "Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather",
    "(Blazing in scarlet battalions)",
    "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme",
    "(Generals order their soldiers to kill)",
    "And gather it all in a bunch of heather",
    "(A cause they've long ago forgotten)",
    "Then she'll be a true love of mine",
    "Are you going to Scarborough Fair?",
    "Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme",
    "Remember me to one who lives there",
    "She once was a true love of mine"
